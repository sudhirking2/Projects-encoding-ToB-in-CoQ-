# Projects-encoding-ToB-in-CoQ-

This represents my work from 2015-2018 on formalizing set theory 
in a higher order logic called ToB, and encoding its proofs in CoQ. 

"Formalization of Set Theory in ToB"  was my passion project during this time under a psudeonym "John Luc Piccard".
It's ambition was to build matheamtics from the ground up and is based on a higher order intuitionstic logic. 
The project was vital for developing my itnerests in formalism; it led me to type theory, interactive theorem provers, and other formal systems.

The other files are CoQ codes which encode my proofs from the above project into CoQ. 
Note they are compiled in CoQIDE under a -noinit- flag. This is because we redefine the logical symbols 
to their CoC counterparts instead of the inductive definitions. 
This process has taught me how to encode proofs from their oral describprtions comonly encountered in matheamtics, 
to higher order logic, to type theory.
